<h3 class="question__title">Systeme Return Policy?</h3>
<div class="question__content">

<strong>Systeme io</strong>Â has a clear process for refunding customers. Customers' transactions can be refunded directly from the Systeme io account. The refund conditions depend on the payment gateways used. For instance, to make a refund, the amount must be available in the balance.

To refund a customer, one needs to navigate to "Sales", and then to "Transactions". All transactions made from the sale of products and courses are displayed there. A specific sale can be found by refining the search using the customer's email address, selecting a price plan they chose, or by defining a time period.

Once the transaction is displayed, clicking on the 3 dots and then on "Refund" initiates the refund process. After confirming the refund, an invoice appears showing a negative amount. This invoice can be sent to customers as proof of refund.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to partially refund a transaction from Systeme io. However, refunding a customer from a bank account and directly from Systeme io does not result in a double refund.

This return policy ensures that customers have a safety net when purchasing products or services through Systeme io. It also adds to the credibility of the businesses using this platform.

<div class="question">
<h3 class="title">Does Systeme have a return policy?</h3>
&nbsp;

</div>
<div class="answer">

Yes,Â <strong>Systeme io</strong>Â does have a return policy. Customers can request a refund for any of their transactions from their Systeme io account. The refund conditions depend on the payment gateways used. For example, to make a refund, the amount must be available in the balance. To refund a customer, go to "Sales", and then to "Transactions". Once the transaction is displayed, click on the 3 dots and then on "Refund". Confirm the refund and that's it! Once the refund is made, an invoice will appear showing a negative amount. This invoice can be sent to customers as proof of refund. Unfortunately, it is not possible to partially refund a transaction from Systeme io. However, it is possible to refund a Systeme io transaction through a personal bank account. Refunding a customer from a personal bank account and directly from Systeme io does not result in a double refund.
